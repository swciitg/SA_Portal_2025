Academic excellence  makes up the forefront of most student's goals. With students already  facing pressures from challenging curricula, the Students' Affairs  Section ensures that a student's academic journey is as smooth and  nourishing as possible. To this end, Students' Affairs acts as a link  between a student and the administration. Students' Affairs also ensures that students have no roadblocks in their academic journey.</p>
            <p>Students' Affairs umbrellas several subdivisions that deal with student  extracurricular activities, including technical, sports and cultural  boards, and subdivisions like the Welfare Board and the Hostel Affairs  Board that ensure the overall well-being and holistic development of a  student.

            <p>These subdivisions of Students' Affairs ensure that no  stone is left unturned in this aspect and that a student's life outside  academics is as fulfilling, enriching and comfortable as possible.</p>
